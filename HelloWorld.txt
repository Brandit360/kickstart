This is to see if indeed i can push something to Github…I think I'm starting to get this stupid shit

DAMN I forgot to Commit

Lets try this 

WHen we first make a repo we need to git init

once thats done we can use git commands in that folder like git status (te check the status of the files)

git add ( to add files so git knows what files to watch)
git add . (to add the current folder)

once added you can make changes to files 

and then you can  git commit -m "message here"

THIS IS IMPORTANT

Every time you make a change to a file you need to Commit it before doing anything else

After that you can git push your changes to github

after pushing you have to add everything again so 

	commit often push when ready

Committing is like Cmmnd-S any file except it creates a snapshot in time so nothing gets deleted

WHERE ARE YOU PUSHING TO? HOW DO YOU CHANGE IT?

git remote -v
# View existing remotes
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo.git (push)

git remote set-url origin https://github.com/user/repo2.git
# Change the 'origin' remote's URL

git remote -v
# Verify new remote URL
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo2.git (fetch)
# origin  https://github.com/user/repo2.git (push)
